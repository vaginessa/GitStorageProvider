# Git Storage Provider

Since KitKat (4.4), the Android OS exposes a framework called *Storage Providers*, to unify the way document can be seen, edited or created across applications. 

This application provides : 

  - a Storage Provider, allowing user to read, edit or create documents through any Android app from and into local git repositories;
  - perform simple git operations locally (`pull`, `commit`, `push`, `tag`).
